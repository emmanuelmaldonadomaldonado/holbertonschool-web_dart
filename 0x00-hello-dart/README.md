# 0x00 Hello Dart

This project contains a series of Dart programs that demonstrate basic programming concepts and syntax in the Dart language. Each program is designed to fulfill specific tasks and showcase different functionalities of Dart.

## File Descriptions

- **0-hello_holberton.dart**: A simple Dart program that prints "Hello Holberton!" followed by a new line.

- **1-quotes.dart**: This program prints the string "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle," followed by a new line.

- **2-print_number.dart**: This file contains a Dart program that prints an integer stored in the variable `number`, followed by "Battery street," and a new line. The code adheres to a strict length of 4 lines and does not cast the variable into a string.

- **3-print_double.dart**: A Dart program that prints a double stored in the variable `number` with a precision of 2 digits, prefixed by "Double:" and followed by a new line.

- **4-print_string.dart**: This program prints a string stored in the variable `str` three times, followed by its first 9 characters, each followed by a new line. The implementation avoids loops and conditional statements, keeping the code within 5 lines.

- **5-assertion.dart**: A Dart program that checks if a number is greater than or equal to 80. If true, it prints "You Passed"; otherwise, it raises an assertion error with a specific message. The program does not use IF/ELSE statements.

- **6-positive_or_negative.dart**: This program determines if a given argument (stored as a string) is positive, negative, or zero. It converts the string to an integer and prints the number followed by its classification.

## Usage

To run any of the Dart programs, use the Dart SDK. Ensure you have Dart installed on your machine. You can execute a program by navigating to the project directory in your terminal and running:

```
dart <filename.dart>
```

Replace `<filename.dart>` with the name of the Dart file you wish to execute.
